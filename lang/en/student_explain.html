<h1>Oxford Brookes Learning Analytics</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Information on your online engagement in Moodle (Virtual
Learning Environment) and the Electronic Library is now available for you to
monitor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The objective is for students to be able to compare their engagement
pattern against their own trend and their cohort. A cohort is the group of
students at the same stage of a course.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your engagement rating is calculated on a weekly basis using
a combination of time spent online, consistency of access, activity while
online and downloads. Weeks run from Monday to Sunday, so it defaults to
showing you data for the last complete week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We understand that not being online does not mean that you
are not active, as depending on the course and your own preferences you can
study from other sources. <b>Your rating is not a score</b>. We compare your
weekly engagement to previous weeks so you can spot if your engagement has
declined at points of the course where it shouldn't. By comparing your rating
to the cohort average you can spot if others are finding material or activities
that you may have missed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The introduction panel that this link was on can be
configured wherever you want it on your Moodle dashboard. It contains a brief
summary with options to drill into the data and get suggestions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first summary point is comparing where you are relative
to others in your cohort, by clicking on the available link you can see this as
a bar chart divided into 'quartiles' with your own engagement highlighted. The
Mean and Median averages are also shown for reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second summary point is to indicate your own trend and
clicking on the link shows you your pattern over the previous weeks, with
options to change the units of measure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third summary point indicates your consistency of online
engagement. Numerous studies show that a regular study pattern is better for
knowledge transfer and retention, rather than a few very long sessions. This
link is work in progress and shows your activity over the last 2 weeks showing
(still being discussed and designed).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lightbulb on the right of the panel shows suggestions
for how you could improve your engagement. The contents will vary but does
include an option to show what other resource sites that your cohort are
regularly using.</p>
